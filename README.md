# wellesley-cs331-finalproject
This repository contains the code for our final project in CS 331, Spring 2023 at Wellesley College.

To run our code with our dataset, run the following command in the terminal:
```
python evaluation.py
```

To run the algorithms that we implemented on a custom graph,
1. Store the decision matrix of your graph as a csv file in the `data` directory. Each row in the matrix should take a separate line. Items in the row are separated by commas.
2. Run 
```
python evaluation.py
```
